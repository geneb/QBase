On October 26th, 2018 I purchased the software assets of Full Moon Software. Full Moon Software used to be known as 
Crescent Software. They produced a line of excellent development libraries for MS-DOS. The supported environments were
QuickBASIC 4.x, Microsoft Professional Development System v7.x, and Visual Basic for DOS.

The idea behind obtaining these products was to release them to the public domain to ensure that people could still 
access these things in the future. While most developers will have no use for these products in a modern develoment 
environment, they still have value as an example of "how it was done" back in the heyday of x86 DOS development.

The software in this repository hasn't been modified from how I received it from Ethan Winer, the original author. 
While all the source files carry some kind of Copyright notice, the software is now in the public domain.

The contents of the installation floppies will be uploaded to the Internet Archive soon and when the manuals are 
scanned, they'll be uploaded there as well. 

The original distribution disk files are available here:

Note that no documentation for QBase has been found.

I've attached the text from Full Moon Software's catalog description of QBase below.


QBase is a revolutionary concept in
BASIC screen and database software,
not only because it's so easy to
use, but also because it does so
much. Where most screen builders
merely create a screen image to be
displayed by your program, QBase
lets you defme data entry fields,
create custom help screens, and even
manage an entire relational database.
